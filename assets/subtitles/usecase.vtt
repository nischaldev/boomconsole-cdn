 00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.240
<v Speaker1> I have been creating lots of tabs on my web
browser.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.520
<v Speaker1>My latest project is organizing a wedding
for my boss.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:11.990
<v Speaker1>So I opened up my Google Bard chat and
asked, what are the things I need to do to

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:13.610
<v Speaker1>prepare and plan for a wedding?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.840
<v Speaker1>And it gave me a huge list of categories and
things I have to do.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.850
<v Speaker1>The wedding is going to be in Beverly Hills,
California, so I went to Google Maps and

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker1>looked for Beverly Hills wedding venues.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.230
<v Speaker1>Look at all these choices.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker1>Wow. So I chose the Beverly Hills Hotel
here, the Four Seasons, Beverly Hills Hotel

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.070
<v Speaker1>here, and the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.330
<v Speaker1>And I left the tabs open so I could discuss
them with my boss when he is available.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.600
<v Speaker1>Now I have to look for places where he can
buy a ring.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker1>So back to Google Maps and looking for
Beverly Hills jewelry shops.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker1>Here's a huge list of the search results.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.310
<v Speaker1>However, I will choose this luxury jewels of
Beverly Hills, this Tiffany and company.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker1>And here, Beverly Hills Jewelers.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.130
<v Speaker1>I opened the pages for these three.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker1>Now I have the Googlebot page.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.420
<v Speaker1>Open the three search maps on Google and the
three hotel websites with a couple tabs for

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.450
<v Speaker1>each venue. So I'm up to ten tabs and only
2% through my list of things to do.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.370
<v Speaker1>I am super frustrated.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker1>Do I really need to print everything and put
it in folders?

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker1>How do I keep track of all these things on
this list without printing everything out?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.570
<v Speaker1>I want a program that lets me create folders
and subfolders to keep track of the wedding

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker1>event. Then I need to keep track of my.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.930
<v Speaker1>I chat with Googlebot about my wedding event
with a description.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker1>Then let me create a folder for rings and a
subfolder for the engagement ring.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.170
<v Speaker1>Then I want to organize the shopping for
engagement rings and pick stores.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker1>I want to look at their phone numbers and
location.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker1>Then I want to save pictures of rings my
boss might like for his engagement.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker1>Then I want to create a folder for wedding
planners and look for a professional wedding

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.500
<v Speaker1>planners to be interviewed on LinkedIn.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.870
<v Speaker1>For that, I will click on the contacts tab
from the extension and select LinkedIn here.

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.670
<v Speaker1>I will search Wedding Planners and Beverly
Hills here in search bar wedding planners to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.980
<v Speaker1>be interviewed. Here I got one.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker1>I will save this contact into my wedding
planners folder.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.580
<v Speaker1>The program that does all this for me.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.490
<v Speaker1>Boom. Console.com and the boom console.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:05.870
<v Speaker1>Chrome web extension.
